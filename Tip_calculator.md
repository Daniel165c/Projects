### **Tip Calculator**

Welcome to Daniel's tip calculator read me file.
This tip calculator will be able to take user input for the following:

1. Total amount of bill,
2. Amount of people splitting the bill,
3. And the tip percentage you wish to apply to the total.

In the end, the script will ask if you would like to recalculate the tip percentage.

In order to run the script, you will need to run the program in a program that has a terminal and a python-based language installed.
